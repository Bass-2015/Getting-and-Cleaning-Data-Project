# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This project is based on creating an R script, called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1- Merges the "training" and the "test" datasets to create one dataset

2- Extracts only the Mean and the Standard Deviation for each measurement

3- Uses descriptive Activity names to name the activities in the dataset

4- Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names

5- Creates a second dataset, from the original dataset, that is a tidy dataset with the average
of each variable for each Activity and each Subject.
